# Sarah's {hackmud} collection

This is my collection of scripts for the game [{hackmud}](https://hackmud.com).
Feel free to use anything in this repo, but be warned, I didn't put a lot of
thought into anything here, so the code quality is abysmal!

Everything in the root folder is stuff I actually use(d).

[experiments](/experiments/) just contains some test scripts that aren't things I intend to
use. Sometimes I just wanna try out some stuff, like having fun with WASM.

[utils.js](/utils.js) contains a random assortment of things I think (or thought) might be
reusable. It also contains all `DATA_CHECK` answers I know of, so spoilers be
ahead!
